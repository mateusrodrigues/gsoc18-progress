# Notes on building the .NET SDK on FreeBSD

## Priority list

- [x] #1 - Finish instructions from [Wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Building-.NET-Core--2.x-on-FreeBSD) to get a working SDK on FreeBSD
  - SDK zipped file available [here](). Bootstrap based on `dotnet-2.2.100-preview1-008958`.
- [ ] #2 - Try to run tests and report outcome (see [#24255](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24255) and [#15674](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/15674))
- [ ] #3 - Write more scripts to automate creation of FreeBSD SDK from step 1
- [ ] #4 - Get official RID for BSD and possibly fix tools and JSON files to use it
- [ ] #5 - [#24259](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24259) could be a problem for PowerShell when it tries to use colors. Check it out.
  - As part of [#26966](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26966), it would probably be ok to fallback to "dumb" terminal if terminfo lookup fails.
